## About

I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu) at Cornell University. I completed my bachelor’s in computer science at [Brown University](http://cs.brown.edu) in 2016, where I worked on some projects using [modeling tools](https://github.com/avanhatt/minimum-spanning-trees-alloy) and [refinement types](https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/capstones/2016/van.hattum.alexa.pdf). I was also a Head Teaching Assistant for Brown's largest introductory course, [CS 15](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/), and a course on modern verification tooling, [CS 195y: Logic for Systems](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs195y/2016/). I then spent 2 years engineering health software at Apple (where I gave a [WWDC talk](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/221/) on my team’s HealthKit framework). My research interests include programming languages, formal methods, distributed systems, and computer science education. [CV](vanhattum_cv_fall_2018.pdf)
