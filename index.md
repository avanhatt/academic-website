## About

I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science][cornellcs] at Cornell University and an [NSF GRFP fellow][grfp]. I work with [Adrian Sampson][adrian] in the [Computer Architecture and Programming Abstractions][capra] research group. My research interests span systems [programming languages][pl], applied formal methods, and usability for programming tools. My current projects, [Hyacinth][] and [Diospyros][], apply solver-aided program synthesis to compiling programs for energy-efficient hardware.

I completed my bachelor’s at [Brown][browncs], where I worked on some projects using [modeling tools][mstalloy] and [refinement types][rtypes]. I then spent two years at Apple engineering [health software][apple] for the iPhone and Apple Watch.
