## About

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu) at Cornell University. I work with [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Computer Architecture and Programming Abstractions](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu) research group. I completed my bachelor’s in computer science at [Brown University](http://cs.brown.edu) in 2016, where I worked on some projects using [modeling tools](https://github.com/avanhatt/minimum-spanning-trees-alloy) and [refinement types](https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/capstones/2016/van.hattum.alexa.pdf). I then spent 2 years engineering health software at Apple. My research interests include [programming languages](http://pl.cs.cornell.edu), formal methods, distributed systems, and computer science education.
